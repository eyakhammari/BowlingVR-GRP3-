# 🎳 Virtual Reality Bowling Game

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a **Virtual Reality Bowling Simulation** developed using **Unity**. It provides an immersive and interactive bowling experience in a 3D environment. The player can roll the ball, hit the pins, and score points just like in a real bowling alley.

---

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ Fully modeled **3D bowling alley**, including:
  - Bowling lane
  - Walls
  - Ball return area
- 🎳 Interactive **bowling ball** with realistic motion and physics
- 🎯 Responsive **bowling pins** that react accurately to collisions
- 🧱 Real-time **physics-based interactions** between the ball, pins, and alley
- 📈 **Score counter** updates automatically based on the number of pins knocked down
- 🧩 Scripted components to manage:
  - Ball throwing mechanics
  - Pin detection and scoring logic
  - Resetting the alley for the next throw

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Unity Engine** (Version XX.X or your version)
- **C#** for scripting game logic
- **VR SDK** (Oculus)
- Built-in Unity **Physics Engine** for collisions and motion

---

## 📜 How It Works

1. The player grabs and throws the ball using VR controllers .
2. The ball moves down the lane using Unity’s Rigidbody and Force mechanics.
3. When the ball collides with the pins:
   - Pins react realistically based on collision force and direction.
   - Knocked-over pins are detected via scripting.
4. The score counter updates to reflect the number of pins hit.
5. After each turn, the alley can be reset for the next shot.



## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Press `Play` and enjoy the game!
